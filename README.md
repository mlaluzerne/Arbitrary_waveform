# Arbitrary_waveform
Create a .txt file with commands to send to a RIGOL DG1000Z Function generator

Open the following link in Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mlaluzerne/Arbitrary_waveform/main)

Open the Arbitrary waveform notebook, change the waveform parameters, change the equation, and run the code to autogenerate commands for the function generator. The last cell will produce a .txt file that can be used for future reference.
